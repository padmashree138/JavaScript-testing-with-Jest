In testing with Jest I learnt about : <br/>
1. Matchers : There are various types of matcher like toBe, toEqual, truthy , falsy , etc.
    - It is used for testing to see if the statement matches, if it does it passes or else it fails.
2. different methods such as promise, callback and await to test the asynchronous code.
3. Mock functions
